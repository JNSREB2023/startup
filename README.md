# Rate My Recipe

## Elevator Pitch

Whenever I am searching for a dinner recipe I come across thousands on the internet, sometimes when I make these recipes I feel like they were never worth my time! Rate My Recipe makes it easier to find recipes that you'll actually enjoy. Through this website users will be able to input recipes for others to try, and view existing recipes other useres input. Users can rate recipes they try and view other ratings to determine if they should try it out!

## Design
Below is a rough sketch for the concept design of the website.

## Key Features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability to input your own recipes
- Ability to rate/comment/view other's recipes
- Ability to scroll and view all recipes in database.

## Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

     - **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. There will be 4 HTML pages for login, create login, homepage, veiwing/rating recipes. Hyperlinks that lead to each page
     - **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast. 
     - **React** - Provides login, option to create recipes, opeion to view others inputs and rate them.
     - **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
        - login
        -
